The American space agency says that its Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) mission and the European Space Agency's (ESA) Swarm satellites found that the effects reached the edge of Earth's atmosphere just a few hours after the underwater eruption. These effects became evident when the two missions found hurricane-speed winds and unusual electric currents formed in the ionosphere- Earth's electrified upper atmospheric layer. The satellites observing the massive phenomenon captured giant plumes of gases, water vapor, and dust being pushed into the sky. Scientists compiling the new findings also reported that the explosion created large pressure disturbances in the atmosphere leading to strong winds reaching speeds up to 724 kmph. Notably, the winds started moving faster as they expanded upwards into thinner atmospheric layers. What's more, is that the explosion also flipped the direction of the flow of particles in the ionosphere, which is always due east. These particles form the electric current \u2013 called the equatorial electrojet \u2013 and are powered by winds in the lower atmosphere.",date:"11/5/2022 ",time:"4:00 PM"},{id:2,heading:"50 years ago, scientists were seeking the cause of psoriasis",image:"./image/2.jpg",desc:"Psoriasis, which affects 2 to 3 percent of the global population, is an inflammatory skin disease marked by red, scaly patches that itch or burn.

Cyclic AMP is just one player alongside other chemical messengers and immune cells, and certain gene variants can make a person more susceptible.

Eating one-fifth less red meat and instead munching on microbial proteins derived from fungi or algae could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050, researchers report May 5 in Nature. Raising cattle and other ruminants contributes methane and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, while clearing forests for pasture lands adds carbon dioxide (SN: 4/4/22; SN: 7/13/21). So the hunt is on for environmentally friendly substitutes, such as lab-grown hamburgers and cricket farming (SN: 9/20/18; SN: 5/2/19). Another alternative is microbial protein, made from cells cultivated in a laboratory and nurtured with glucose. Fermented fungal spores, for example, produce a dense, doughy substance called mycoprotein, while fermented algae produce spirulina, a dietary supplement.  Cell-cultured foods do require sugar from croplands, but studies show that mycoprotein produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses less land and water than raising cattle, says Florian Humpen\xf6der, a climate modeler at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. However, a full comparison of foods\u2019 future environmental impacts also requires accounting for changes in population, lifestyle, dietary patterns and technology, he says.",date:"11/5/2022 ",time:"6:32 AM"},{id:4,heading:"Science Doesn't Always Boost Sales, Study Finds",image:"./image/4.jpg",desc:"Using science to sell chocolate chip cookies and other yummy products is likely to backfire, a new study shows, but touting scientific research behind more practical, everyday items -- such as body wash -- can be an effective marketing strategy.<br>'People see science as cold, but competent. That doesn't pair well with products designed to be warm and pleasurable to consumers,' explained study co-author Rebecca Reczek, a professor of marketing at Ohio State University.<br>'But the cold competence of science is seen as perfectly appropriate to sell practical products that serve a utilitarian purpose,' Reczek said in a school news release. Her team conducted a series of experiments with hundreds of U.S. college students. In one, students were given a menu with three chocolate chip cookie choices -- option A, B or C -- that were described in different terms. Half of the participants had a menu that described option A as having 'Luscious chocolatey taste,' while the other had a menu that described option A as 'Scientifically developed to have a luscious chocolatey taste.' On both menus, options B and C were the same and didn't mention science. The science reference reduced the likelihood that participants would choose option A by 30%, according to the study. The results were published May 5 in the Journal of Consumer Research. In another experiment, participants said they were more likely to buy a new body wash if they were told the lather will 'wash away odor-causing bacteria,' rather than the lather will 'immerse your senses in an indulgent experience. 'And another experiment found that mentioning a 'rigorous scientific development process' in marketing an indulgent smoothie brand was described by participants as 'disjointed.' They were also more likely to say 'something seemed weird about the slogan.' The findings have implications beyond marketing, according to Reczek.'The fact that consumers have stereotypes about science and scientists may be a barrier to accepting science, whether it is products or scientific findings,' she said.'People need a more realistic view of what scientists are really like and how science is a part of our everyday lives, including many of the products we use,' Reczek added.",date:"10/5/2022 ",time:"11:00 PM"},{id:5,heading:"Here\u2019s the latest good and bad news about COVID-19 drugs",image:"./image/5.jpg",desc:"Maybe you\u2019ve heard that the pandemic is over in the United States.

Many people have been relying on vaccines to control outbreaks, and there is renewed attention on getting newly available treatments to sick people. But coronavirus cases are on the rise again with more than a quarter of counties reporting high levels of transmission. And those are official numbers. No one really knows how many at-home tests come back positive and are never reported (SN: 4/22/22).
